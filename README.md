Data Analysis Using R - Male Fertility data.

In this project I have done a data analysis on Fertility Dataset from "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Fertility".
The data available is in .txt which was converted to .csv in excel and was later used for the analysis.
The data was categorical so Logistic regression was performed on the data. 
The model created on the data was then was checked for accuracy.
